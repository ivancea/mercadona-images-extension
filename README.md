# Mercadona images script

## Description

A Tampermonkey script to show images in the old Mercadona website.

It takes the images from the new Mercadona, and shows them in the old one.

It also re-styles the page by changing the table to a grid style.

## How to use

1. Install Tampermonkey extension in your browser
2. In the extension options, add a new script
3. Copy the code from the `tampermonkey.js` file and paste it in the new script
4. Make sure the script is enabled
5. Go to the Mercadona website or reload it

Now, while searching the products, you should see a grid instead of the table.

Note: It may take some time (Less than a second) for the new grid to appear. If it doesn't, try reloading the page, checking the instructions again, or opening an issue.
